# Agent in a Box
The Agent in a Box provides a framework for developing autonomous mobile robots using Beliefs-Desires-Intentions (BDI) and Jason (https://github.com/jason-lang/jason, http://jason.sourceforge.net/). It has been designed to work with ROS (https://www.ros.org/) using the savie_ros_bdi node (https://github.com/NMAI-lab/savi_ros_bdi) although it is also possible to use the behaviour framework without ROS.

This documnent provides a brief explanation of the Agent in a Box as well as how to use it. Additional documentation is available in published papers. There are also a number of demo projects that have used the Agent in a Box. These serve as good working examples of how to use the framework.
